# keyword_spotting_russian_swear
The aim of this project is to spot a set of Russian swear words in real Russian speech. We compare different models, Whisper-based embeddings and embeddings across different transformer layers of the Wav2Vec2 encoder, try other loss strategies, and perform error analyses to uncover correlations of robust classification performance.
